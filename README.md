Governance Adaxa Token
## Adaxa Token Ecosystem
**Cryptoasset for decentralized cooperative finance**

Current financial systems are in constant research and implementation due to the extensive benefits that the usability of Blockchain provides in their systems; due to the great utility and security that it offers them, so it has become a very transparent and comfortable way for all users who make use of its benefits for their transactions.
That is why a decentralized cooperative financial solution based on a utility governance Token is implemented, which gives all its users a safe and reliable system where the entire user community can make decisions regarding traceability of the Token.

**ADAXA TOKEN ECOSYSTEM**

The Adaxa Token is a decentralized fungible token of financial utility, developed with the purpose of establishing a cooperative governance system to cover the secure exchanges of balances widely accepted by the cryptoactive community, thus having several benefits and functionality for the benefit of all its users.

In its initial stage it has the following benefits:
* Decentralized governance system.
* Open source decentralized exchange (Dex) platform.
* Scalability towards a Stablecoin minted with the Adaxa Token.

Which have several programs and related services that expand the Adaxa Token ecosystem in order to provide greater solutions to its users.

**TECHNICAL ASPECTS**
- **Network:** xDaiChain
- **Token Type:** ERC-20
- **Gas Fee:** 0,1 xDai By Transfer
- **Transfer Time:** 5 Second maximum
- **Total Supply:** 100.000.000 **(No more Token will be created)**

**FEATURES**
- **Pausable:** Security Feature and Specific Functions Pause.
- **Burnable:** 1 Finney transfer fee that goes to a fee treasury smart contract for subsequent scheduled burning (semi-annual or annual) with governance approval. This fee will stop when the programmed burning of 90% of the Max Supply is achieved **(Only 10% of the total Max Supply will remain as circulating in the ecosystem).**
- **Votable:** It allows decision-making and elections of decentralized governance.

**DISTRIBUTION**

The Adaxa Token has a Max Supply of 100 million of Token **(No more Token will be created)** which are generated from the initial smart contract of the Token.

It will be distributed in a decentralized manner by other smart contracts which have the amounts shown below. 

- **Initial Governance**

**STRATEGIC PLAN**

**Q2 - 2021**

0.	Adaxa Token Contract Deployment.
1.	Consolidation in the user community.
2.	Strengthening the decentralized cooperative governance system.
3.	Initial distribution for the juries and members chosen for the nascent governance and users benefited by the program.
4.	Initial governance assembly to establish initial regulations.
5.	Launch of version 1.0 of the decentralized open source exchange platform, which has different exchange channels for the Token.
6.	Launch of the open source development program that invites programmers and users to develop technological solutions that improve or integrate into the Token ecosystem.
7.	Decentralized distribution of the Token through the programs approved in an assembly by the governance.

**Q3 - 2021**

8.	Launch of Stablecoin that has the possibility of minting with the Adaxa Token, xDai and USDC.
9.	Launch of the loan and crowdfunding system for projects approved by decentralized governance.

**Q1 - 2022**

10.	 Cover 50% of the target market.
11.	 Expand the project's sources of income.
12.	 Scalability of the ecosystem by improving the systems and platforms developed and implementing new technological solutions for the ecosystem.

**Q2 - 2022**

13.	Launch of a friendly open source wallet that facilitates physical payments through the NFC function and integrates physical Payment Solutions, which covers the cost of gas fee in transfers.

**DECENTRALIZATION AND OPEN SOURCE**

The Adaxa Token focuses on the use of smart contracts for its decentralization and usability, which are available to the user community in the GitHub repository.
The codes related to the web platform and other solutions of the Adaxa Token ecosystem are open source and can also be found in the GitHub repository.

[GitHub Adaxa-Core](https://github.com/adaxa-core).

**DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE**

It will focus on making decisions regarding the traceable course of the Adaxa Token and other laws that condition the Token, taking into account the initial specifications set out in this technical document.
